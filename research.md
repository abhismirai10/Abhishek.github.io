# Research

## Overview
This research explores the transition from classical robotics to **end-to-end learning-based methods** for robotic manipulation. The goal is to create adaptable, cost-effective systems capable of handling dynamic real-world scenarios.

## Classical Robotics: Pick-and-Place Pipeline
- **Framework**: Built using the Drake robotics framework with a KUKA iiwa robot.
- **Key Features**:
  - Defined spatial transformations and trajectories for pick-and-place tasks.
  - Achieved high precision using pseudoinverse-based inverse kinematics.
- **Limitations**:
  - Sensitivity to object variations.
  - Lack of adaptability in dynamic environments.
  - Challenges with kinematic singularities.

## Learning-Based Approaches: ACT and Diffusion Policies
### 1. Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT)
- **Focus**: Predicting temporally coherent action sequences to minimize errors.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Action Chunking**: Groups actions to ensure smooth execution.
  - **Temporal Ensembling**: Mitigates abrupt transitions.
- **Applications**:
  - Pick-and-place tasks.
  - Object sliding.
- **Key Advantage**: Superior motion fluidity.

### 2. Diffusion Policies
- **Focus**: High-precision trajectory refinement through iterative denoising.
- **Techniques**:
  - Models trajectory distributions in action space.
  - Iteratively adjusts actions to account for variations.
- **Applications**:
  - Object stacking.
  - Complex rotations and orientation tasks.
- **Key Advantage**: Handles dynamic changes effectively.
